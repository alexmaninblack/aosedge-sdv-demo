# CARLA–AosEdge Integration

This repository owns the reproducible integration between the native Apple
Silicon CARLA/VISS environment and AosEdge. It does not vendor CARLA, Unreal
Engine, AosCore, or AosVM images.

The first milestone boots the official AosVM 6.1.0 `qemuarm64` image on an
Apple Silicon Mac. Later milestones will deploy an AosEdge-managed service that
consumes the project's VISS 3.1 telemetry and, if justified, add an adapter to
the legacy AOS Vehicle Information Service interface.

- [AOS-0: boot official ARM64 AosVM on Apple Silicon](docs/aos-0-arm64-vm.md)
- [Repository and artifact boundaries](docs/decisions/0001-repository-and-artifact-boundaries.md)

## Current status

Planning is complete for AOS-0. No VM image has been downloaded and no host
dependency has been installed yet.

## Repository policy

This repository is intended to be public. Never commit credentials,
certificates containing private keys, SDK account data, downloaded VM images,
runtime disks, logs containing secrets, CARLA build output, or restricted
Unreal Engine material.
